The dictionary file passed can be whatever the user chooses.
The passwords.txt file that is a companion to this script is spefically designed for crimeware variants such as Valak, Ursnif, and Dridex that are often delivered as ZIP archives.
The only dependency the user should need is pyzipper. See this documentation to install: https://pypi.org/project/pyzipper/
